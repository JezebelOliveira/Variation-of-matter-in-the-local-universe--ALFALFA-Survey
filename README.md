A measurement of the matter variation in the local Universe and of $\sigma_8$ is obtained through neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) sources provided by the ALFALFA catalog. 
By examining the observational data of nearby galaxies, we aim to quantify the spatial correlations between these objects and 
thus determine the amplitude and correlation scale of density fluctuations in the local Universe.
